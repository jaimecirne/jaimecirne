Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate web developer and IT infrastructure professional with over a decade of experience. My journey started in 2008 as a web developer, and since then, I've been dedicated to honing my skills and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies.

During my career, I've had the privilege of working as an information technology technician at the prestigious Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, where I played a key role in supporting their IT infrastructure. As the demands in the field of IT infrastructure grew, I transitioned into this domain, gaining valuable experience and participating in scientific research initiatives.

In addition to my practical experience, I hold a professional master's degree in software engineering, which has further enhanced my knowledge and expertise in software development. I focused my studies on software development in the context of neuroscience and digital game development, exploring innovative ways to apply technology in these fields.

On my GitHub, you'll find a collection of my projects and contributions in web development and software engineering. I strive to write clean, efficient code and leverage the latest frameworks and tools to create robust applications. Feel free to explore my repositories and discover my passion for technology and problem-solving.

I'm always open to collaborations and new opportunities, so if you'd like to connect or discuss potential projects, please don't hesitate to reach out. Let's work together to drive innovation and create impactful solutions in the world of technology.
